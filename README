git-monkey: a simple repo manager for debian-based projects.

To use, you need file in your home folder called ".git-monkey".

Within it, you put entries like this:

/home/mtwebster/bin/cinnamon, mint, master
/home/mtwebster/bin/cinnamon-session, origin, master

That is, 

<path-to-git-project>   ,  <upstream remote name>  ,  <upstream tracking branch>
