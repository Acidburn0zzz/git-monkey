git-monkey: a simple repo manager for debian-based projects.

To use, you need file in your home folder called ".git-monkey".

Within it, you put entries like this:

/home/mtwebster/bin/cinnamon, mint, master
/home/mtwebster/bin/cinnamon-session, origin, master

That is, 

<path-to-git-project>   ,  <upstream remote name>  ,  <upstream tracking branch>

There's a sample that has the current cinnamon stack in /usr/lib/git-monkey - 
copy to your home, change the folder names, and rename to .git-monkey



TODO:

- Add more config options, add repos by picking folder and automagically acquiring upstream and remotes to select
- Add more developer options - commit, push, auto-open url of pull request.
